## WebSocket Connection

### Connecting to Vent Room
To receive real-time updates, establish a WebSocket connection to the server.

**WebSocket URL:** `wss://api.joinhafar.com/ws/`

**Authentication:** Required (JWT token in connection params or headers)

### Joining the Vent Room Feed

After connecting, join the general Vent Room feed to receive updates about new posts.

**Client sends:**
```json
{
  "type": "join_ventroom"
}
```

**Server response:**
```json
{
  "type": "ventroom_joined",
  "data": {
    "message": "Successfully joined Ventroom",
    "user_id": "uuid-string"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Leaving the Vent Room Feed

**Client sends:**
```json
{
  "type": "leave_ventroom"
}
```

### Joining a Specific Post

To receive real-time updates for a specific post (comments, reactions, etc.), join the post channel.

**Client sends:**
```json
{
  "type": "join_ventroom_post",
  "data": {
    "post_id": 1
  }
}
```

**Server response:**
```json
{
  "type": "ventroom_post_joined",
  "data": {
    "post_id": 1,

  "content_type": [
    "Invalid content type. Must be 'ventpost' or 'ventcomment'."
  ]

## Best Practices

### WebSocket Connection

1. **Maintain Persistent Connection:** Keep WebSocket connection alive for real-time updates
2. **Implement Reconnection Logic:** Auto-reconnect on disconnect with exponential backoff
3. **Join Appropriate Groups:**
   - Join `ventroom_feed` when user opens Ventroom section
   - Join `vent_post_{id}` when user views a specific post
   - Leave groups when navigating away to conserve resources

### Real-time Event Handling

1. **Event Types:** Handle all relevant event types in your client
2. **UI Updates:** Update UI immediately upon receiving WebSocket events
3. **Optimistic Updates:** Show user actions immediately, rollback on error
4. **Deduplicate Events:** Same event may arrive via multiple groups - deduplicate by ID

### API Usage

1. **Pagination:** Always use pagination for list endpoints
2. **Caching:** Leverage 5-minute cache for feed data
3. **View Tracking:** GET requests to post detail automatically increment views
4. **Permissions:** Check user permissions before showing edit/delete options

### Media Uploads

1. **File Size:** Keep media files under 10MB for optimal performance
2. **Formats:** Use standard formats (MP4 for video, MP3 for audio, JPG/PNG for images)
3. **Compression:** Compress media before upload
4. **Preview:** Show upload progress and preview to user

### Performance Optimization

1. **Lazy Loading:** Load comments on-demand when user scrolls
2. **Image Optimization:** Use thumbnails for feed, full size for detail view
3. **Batch Updates:** Group multiple reaction updates if receiving rapidly
4. **Connection Pooling:** Reuse WebSocket connection across components

### Notifications

1. **Push Notifications:** Automatically sent for comments and reactions
2. **In-app Notifications:** Show via WebSocket for real-time updates
3. **Notification Preferences:** Respect user notification settings
4. **Rate Limiting:** Throttle notifications to avoid overwhelming users

---
## Rate Limiting

- **Standard endpoints:** 100 requests per minute
- **Create endpoints:** 20 requests per minute
- **Reaction endpoint:** 60 requests per minute

Exceeded rate limits will return:
```json
{
  "detail": "Request was throttled. Expected available in 45 seconds."
}
```
